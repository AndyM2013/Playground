This depository stores some of my experimented projects. Welcome to check it out and give any feedback, so that we can improve the cases even better.

**[01-Classification-Modeling-on-Hotel-Scoring](https://github.com/TomLin/Playground/blob/master/01-Classification-Modeling-on-Hotel-Scoring.ipynb)**<br/>
Comparing the performance of models among MLP, Xgboost, and Logistic, and choose **Logistic Model** as the final choice. **The final model reaches 0.62 in accuracy and 0.61 in F1 score in three classes scenario.** If we look deeper, the share of each class are 35%, 29%, 36%, which compared to the precision from the predicted result for each class 68%, 47%, 65%, we can say that **Logistic Model doubles the precision** generally.
